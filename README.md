# Practical Ethical Hacking
These are my personal notes, created during an online course from [TCM Security](https://tcm-sec.com/about)

I'm just a student learning these stuffs. I might be wrong somewhere, their can be typo or little bit of wrong concepts or some sort of gap in understanding.
I'm not a native English speaker, I made these easy to understand.
