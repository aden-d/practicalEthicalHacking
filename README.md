# Practical Ethical Hacking
These are my personal notes, created during a online course from TCM Security.

I'm just a student learning these stuffs. I might be wrong somewhere, their can be type or little bit of not wrong concepts or some sort of gap in understanding.
I'm not a native English speaker, I made these easy to understand.
Your contribution to topics is always welcome and will be much appreciated.
